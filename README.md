## Background

Leading Chess Grand Masters prepare for their Chess matches by working with a team of other top Chess Grand Masters.  A team collects and studies all the past games of each opponent from the Chess database.  Match preparation requires advanced opponent-specific personalized training plans.

## Objective

NextMOVE is an effort to build a Personalized Chess Training Assistant.  For opponent-specific preparation, their past games can be uploaded to this Assistant.  Next moves for each board position can be predicted based on each
playerâ€™s style and tendencies.
